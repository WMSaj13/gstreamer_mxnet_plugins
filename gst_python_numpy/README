Here is how I set up docker (on mac):
	brew install docker docker-machine
	docker-machine create --driver virtualbox dev
	eval $(docker-machine env dev)

To build and run the image, use the following:
	docker build -t gstest .
	docker run -it gstest

To stop and remove modified containers it shall be possible to do:
	docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
	docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)

An example command to generate the test video signal, process it with
our plugin and encode to the video file is the following:

	gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc ! video/x-raw,format=RGBA  ! simple_numpy ! videoconvert ! theoraenc ! oggmux ! filesink location=/tmp/foo.ogg

You can grab the image from the container to the host. First, list all running
containers with "docker ps". Then, use the container ID from the first column
in the following command:
	docker cp ID:/tmp/foo.ogg .

The plugin will crash with SIGSEGV if image is not in a 4-byte format
(because the buffer is interpreted as NumPy array of 32-bit words).
I think this can be improved by limiting the supported image format
in the plugin caps list.
